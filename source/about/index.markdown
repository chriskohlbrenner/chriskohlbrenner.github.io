Chris is a web developer. He has the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> (Ruby-004) to thank for much of his programming knowledge.

Chris likes to move around. He has lived in Chicago, Illinois; Amman, Jordan; Cairo, Egypt; urban and suburban New York; and El Paso, TX. In college he spent a year, cumulatively, in Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt.

Chris' interests include (in addition to programming) economic development, religion and spirituality, international travel (see above), and foreign languages (Arabic, German, French, and Spanish, so far...).

He is on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/ckohlbrenner">@CKohlbrenner</a>). You can follow him.
