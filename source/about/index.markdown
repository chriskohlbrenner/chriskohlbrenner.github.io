<h5>Chris</h5>
Chris is a web developer. He has the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> (Ruby-004) to thank for much of his programming knowledge.

Chris likes to move around. He has lived in Chicago, Illinois; Amman, Jordan; Cairo, Egypt; urban and suburban New York; and El Paso, TX. In college he spent a year, cumulatively, in Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt.

Chris' interests (in addition to programming) include economic development, religion and spirituality, international travel (see above), and foreign languages (Arabic, German, French, and Spanish, so far...).
