Chris is learning to code at the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. He has made his home in Chicago, Illinois; Amman, Jordan; Cairo, Egypt; urban and suburban New York; and El Paso, TX. In college he spent a year, cumulatively, in Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt.

He is defined by more than his attendance of Flatiron School and previous residences, but--for now--that's all he's included here.
