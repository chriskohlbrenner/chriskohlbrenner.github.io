Maybe it's just because it was a Monday. Or maybe it's because our recent material pushed me even farther outside of my comfort zone than I already was. Maybe I was unrealistically comparing myself to brilliant classmates who happen to have more experience with web apps. Or maybe it's any number of the myths referenced in <a href="http://stephaniehoh.github.io/blog/2013/11/06/the-myth-of-i-cant-code/">this alum's blog post</a>.

For whatever reason, yesterday was a tough one for me. But those thoughts are myths. The reality is that I've learned a ton in just one month, and that moments like these are normal for a beginner who's learning this quickly. So here's to commemorating the rough moments so I can look back on them and realize what I've accomplished.
