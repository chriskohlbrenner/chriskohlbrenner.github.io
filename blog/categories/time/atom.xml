    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dealing with time can be difficult. <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Time.html">ActiveSupport</a> helps. Store daily time values (e.g., daily schedules, irrespective of date) in a database as offsets from midnight (in seconds).</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m working on a trip planner app using NJ Transit data to find the next departure time for a trip, given its origin and destination. For example, what&rsquo;s the next train leaving Hoboken for Secaucus?</p>

<p><img src="/images/hoboken_secaucus.png"></p>

<h4>It works!</h4>


<p>At least as a proof of concept (<a href="https://github.com/chriskohlbrenner/njtransit">full code here</a>). I know, it&rsquo;s Jersey&mdash;not that great. Also messy SQL/Active Record queries&hellip; Those things aside, the fact that it&rsquo;s working means an annoying hurdle is behind me (or I at least better understand how to get around it). That hurdle is <strong>comparing time</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->




<!-- Making sense of Arel and ActiveRecord queries is an issue unto itself (and perhaps the subject of a future post), but  -->


<h3>About Time Comparisons</h3>


<p>To determine the <i>next</i> departure time, I need to determine a time from the database with the current time. Not as easy as it seems.</p>

<!-- the There's a lot going on behind the scenes--Rails and ActiveRecord and database associations and all--but some of the main code is below. -->


<p>The code below is a big part of what enabled the screenshot above. That&rsquo;s good, it works. But it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>

<p><code>Time.now</code> is straightforward enough. And <code>.where(&ldquo;departure_time&rdquo; > ?, &lt;time>)</code> makes sense&mdash;it&rsquo;s an <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record query</a> that fires a SQL statement comparing the departure times from the database with the current time. But what about the <code>.change(year: 2000, month: 01, day: 01)</code>, especially with the appended <code>&ndash; 18000</code>?</p>

<h3>Active Support and the <code>change</code> helper</h3>


<p>Enter <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html">Active Support</a>, specifically its <strong>Time</strong> class (<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Time.html">documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/calculations.rb">full source code</a>). Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11973225/rails-how-to-store-time-of-day-for-schedule/15350965#15350965">this StackOverflow answer</a>, I was directed to the ActiveSupport helpers. These inlude <code>beginning_of_day()</code>, <code>seconds_until_end_of_day()</code>, <code>days_in_month(month, year = now.year)</code>, and dozens of other awesome helpers.</p>

<p>As my code shows, I chose the <code><a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Time.html#method-i-change">change(options)</a></code> helper. This helper returns a new Time based on a number of parameters. It got the job done, but it was only necessary because of a formatting issue (I also left my previous attempts in the code as artifacts&mdash;evidence of my failed attempts at hacking through the time comparison).</p>

<p>The original values I used to populate my database were CSVs, meaning that the time values were strings, like <code>09:30:00</code> (hour/minute/second). Simple enough, except that when I seeded the database with those strings as time values, they created values like this: <code>2000-01-01 09:30:00 UTC</code>. Basically, those time values (as strings) were converted to instances of the Time class, which include year, month, day, and timezone with defaults of 2000, 01, 01, and UTC.</p>

<p>My solution&mdash;hacky as it was&mdash;was to <code>change</code>my <code>Time.now</code> to match that format, hence my <code>Time.now</code> of <code>2014-03-27 09:30:00 -400</code> became <code>2014-03-27 09:30:00 -500</code>. This was still off because of the time zone, hence the <code>&ndash; 18000</code>. 18000 seconds is how many hours? Five, the exact number I needed to offset for the timezone (UTC, or Coordinated Universal Time, is treated as equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time).</p>

<h3>There's got to be a better way</h3>


<p>There is. A lot of what I did is unnecessary. In theory, the dates don&rsquo;t even need to match up&mdash;I could just calculate the difference and append a different value than the 18000 to compensate (though it&rsquo;d be more difficult to conceptualize). Even that is bad. What I really want to do is store those initial values (the time strings) as <strong>offsets from midnight in seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>In a roundabout way, I&rsquo;m back to the original StackOverflow answer, which suggests storing database values as seconds from midnight. I&rsquo;m still working out how, given strings like &ldquo;06:48:00&rdquo;, I can populate my database with offsets from midnight (24480), but I&rsquo;ve played with irb enough (requiring &lsquo;active_support/time&rsquo;) to know that <code>Time.parse(&ldquo;06:48:00&rdquo;).seconds_since_midnight</code> works. Now I just need to refactor to make that work in my app.</p>
